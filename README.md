<h2>Support Vector Machine with Numpy and Python</h2>

<h3>Intro</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Splitting the data in the best posible way - to get two data categories/labels.</li>
  <li>The key aspect is to split the data in the as much optimal way as possible so that new coming in data can be precisely clasified.</li>
  <li>The data can be split in different ways. However, the line making the biggest gap between two classes is chosen as the separation line.</li>
  <li>Support vectors are extreme points of a specific data set of one category.</li>
  <li>Support vectors are those elements of the data that makes the biggest possible separation gap.</li>
  <li>Distance margin is the distance between support vectors from both data classes.</li>
  <li>Once we create an optimal separation line we can easily see which side a new data fits in.</li>
  <li>The smaller the distance margin, the higher a chance of miss-classification is.</li>
  <li>If all of the data is placed in one line in 1D then we need to convert it into 2D with <b>kernel</b></li>
  <li>If one data of one class is sourrounded by data of second class we need to convert 2D into 3D with <b>kernel</b></li>
</ul>
